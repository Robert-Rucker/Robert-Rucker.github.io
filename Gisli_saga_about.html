	<h1>Welcome to the Gisli Sursson’s Saga Map Project</h1>
<p>This project focuses on three map styles depending on your needs as a student, hobbyist, or researcher and how the saga progresses across time and space.  Depending on your needs hopefully we have a map that fits it. The descriptions of the chapters are from the Martin Regal translation and the nodes came from the Icelandic Sagas Project by Dr. Emily Lethbridge.  Both Regal and Lethbridge have contributed greatly to the worlds understanding of the Icelandic Sagas and this project would not have been possible without their works.  While Gisli’s Saga does include several places across Northern Europe most of the book takes place on the Northwest part of Iceland.  You will want to zoom in on that section eventually with all of the maps so you can clearly see all of the locations since they are heavily cluttered on top of each other.  Remember while the Vikings were capable of traveling to far regions in their time the sagas heavily focused Iceland as it was the last holdout for Viking culture.</p>
<p>The first map focuses heavily on the information in Gisli’s Saga such as location type, latitude and longitude, locations broken down by chapter, and a highlight bar to select across a span of multiple chapters as the locations first appear.  There are three different map types to select from so users can see how the terrain looks with the topographical map, a more simplistic map from Open Street that shows where the locations are relative to current day locations, and a color blind friendly map that makes seeing the green and purple markers easier to see.  For the markers the Green nodes are non-highlighted and the Purple are the highlighted chapters within the double selection bar on the lower right hand corner.  This allows users to focus on locations as the pop up for the first time in the saga.  </p>
<p>The second map focuses on the time aspect as well as how often the location is visited throughout the saga.  Users can cycle through the locations by either clicking on the bar to skip ahead or can casually press forward and see the changes within the locations across the map.  There is also play features that will show the map populate the locations steadily and the locations will grow in either first time visits or constant returns with the circle growing over time.  The side bar notes when the location is first visited and how many chapters it is visited overall.  If the user clicks on a location they are told the name and how many times the location is mentioned within Gisli’s Saga.  The watercolor map is to give the map an older look and feel, but might not show up on older web browsers.  If you do not see the map please check your plugins or if an update is needed.  If the problem continues please use the Contact Us and we will change the map layer to something in the future.</p>
<p>The third map is a search feature map.  The locations are searchable within some margin of error so users might see locations that are not exact for their search.  Most of the Icelandic named locations are searchable, but the current search feature does not readily understand all of the Icelandic names so it is in the user’s best interest to try and look up the names in English first.  The side box also offers users to see how many locations in the saga are farms, fjords, valleys, and assemblies.  Assemblies are not often and are significant parts of the sagas because they are used for times of dispute and law enforcement.  Farms are noted because a Viking that owned his own farm had made it in a sense back in this era as they had land to call their own.  The fjords and valleys are notable locations due to there being confrontations at these places and were often settlement areas.  There are two options for maps the first is a black and white overlay and is intended to be a colorblind friendly options and the other is a watercolor map.  If the watercolor map is not functioning properly please see if your browser is up to date as older versions of web browsers have had issues with the watercolor layer.</p>
